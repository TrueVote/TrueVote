# TrueVote

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a robust system of voting, built
onto the tangle, that allows subversive, rebellious groups to vote in
the face of an oppressive government.

Our main use case, and basis for modelling this codebase is the Catalan
Referendum, where the region of Catalan was trying to vote to secede
from the Spanish union.
