# TrueVote Engine

## Introduction

We are using the [IOTA tangle](https://iota.org/) to store all our vote data. We will do this by sening transactions of 0 value to the tangle an encoding the vote information in the message attached to the transfer. Below we define the basic functions required for such a system.

### Poll Initialization

* ##### format: poll initialization metadata

      {
            "poll_id": STRING,
            "vote_definitions": [
                  {
                        "title": STRING,
                        "responses": {
                              response_string_0: response_id_0,
                              response_string_1: response_id_1,
                              ...
                              response_string_n: response_id_n
                        },
                        "min_num_responses": NUMBER (0 <= NUMBER <= n),
                        "max_num_responses": NUMBER (0 <= NUMBER <= n)
                  }
            ],
            "start_time": DATETIME,
            "end_time": DATETIME,
            "poll_operators": [
                  HASHED_KEY_0,
                  HASHED_KEY_1
            ]
      }

* ##### function: initializePoll(poll_metadata):
      '''
      @summary:
        (i) ensure this is a unique poll ID
        (ii) add poll initialization message to the ledger with the poll metadata
      @returns:
        202 - OK poll ID is unique and poll initialization message successfully
            added to the leger with the poll metadata
        406 - ERROR poll ID was is unique
        500 - ERROR poll initialization message was not added to the ledger or
            ledger could not successfully be queried properly
      '''

* ##### function: ensureUniquePollId(poll_id):
      '''
      @summary: check the ledger to ensure that there currently exists no poll on the
              the ledger with the passed in poll ID
      @returns: 
        200 - OK poll ID is unique
        406 - ERROR poll ID is not unique
        500 - ERROR ledger could not be queried properly
      '''

### Vote Placement

* ##### format: vote placement data

      {
            "poll_id": STRING,
            "vote_responses": {
                  title: {
                        response_string_0: response_id_0,
                        response_string_1: response_id_1,
                        ...
                        response_string_n: response_id_n
                  }
            },
            "poll_operator": HASHED_KEY,
            "unique_user_identifier": ???
      }

* ##### function: getVoteOptions(poll_id):
      '''
      @summary: get a list of possible vote options for a passed in poll ID
      @returns:
        200 - OK a list of the vote options for the specified poll
        400 - ERROR poll ID does not exist
        500 - ERROR ledger could not be queried
      '''

* ##### function: placeVote(poll_id):
      '''
      @summary: adds a vote to the ledger and verifies that it is a valid vote
      @returns:
        200 - OK vote was added to the ledger
        400 - ERROR poll ID does not exist or vote option does not exist for the 
            specified poll or the number of votes is not appropriate for the poll
        500 - ERROR could not query or add to the ledger
      '''

## Challenges

- ensuring that random user cannot simply add an entry to the ledger that will emulate our data format & be counted as a vote
- verifying keys of poll operators when placing votes
- encrypting vote data
- ensure vote has been accepted on tangle
